# 42 - The Piscine


**The highlight of the selection at 42 is the Piscine.**

You don’t have to know how to code to apply to the Piscine at 42. Whatever your starting level is, the idea is to test the candidates’ involvement capacity during the Piscine at 42. Rather than offering a straight computer initiation, the Piscine at 42 lets you start the curriculum with intensive training in C, the first language you have to use during the training course. For one month, the Piscine at 42 lets you tackle the teaching methods of the school: peer-to-peer learning, group work, peer-evaluation and project pedagogy.

## The highlights of the Piscine at 42
### Learning modules
42’s Piscine exercises are grouped in modules. You will need one day, more or less, to complete one. These modules let you focus on one specific notion. 

### Peer evaluations
In addition to an automated evaluation, all the modules must be evaluated by other candidates in the Piscine at 42. This is an opportunity to discover other ways to program and discuss topics tackled in the exercise. Even if the assessor and the assessed are not at the same level, everyone can benefit from this experience.

### Rushes for group work
During weekends, mandatory work groups let students collaborate on projects. The aim is to make you surpass yourself and find a unique solution to a given problem. Rushes are evaluated by the pedagogical staff or advanced students participating in educational activities. Advice given during the evaluations are precious and offers you thorough feedback about the way you code. 

### Machine exams to test yourself
Once a week, a machine exam is proposed. You must solve increasingly difficult problems in a limited time in order to test your level and use what you’ve learned. You will not get any help here. This is an opportunity to observe your progression and achievement and go beyond. You will find solutions to problems you were absolutely clueless about days or weeks before.
